# View Timetable

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to the Timetable Page**
   - Use the navigation menu at the top to go to the **Timetable** page.

2. **Generate Timetable**
   - If you have added exams and set your preferences, click **Generate Timetable** to create your revision schedule.
   - The timetable is generated based on your preferences and exams.

3. **View Your Exams**
   - At the top of the timetable screen, all your upcoming exams are displayed for quick reference.
   - Exams are presented in a card format showing:
     - **Subject**
     - **Exam Date**
     - **Time of Day** (Morning, Afternoon, or Evening)
     - **Board**
     - **Teacher**
   - This allows you to easily keep track of your exams while viewing your revision schedule.

4. **Understand the Calendar View**
   - The timetable is displayed as a traditional monthly calendar grid optimized for all devices.
   - Each day in the calendar shows the date.

5. **Subject Indicators with Colored Dots**
   - Each revision session is represented by a **colored dot** corresponding to its subject.
   - The colors are **unique per subject**, allowing you to quickly identify which subjects you will be studying on each day.
   - **Multiple Dots**:
     - If you have multiple revision sessions for different subjects on the same day, multiple colored dots are displayed.
   - **Legend**:
     - A legend is displayed below the calendar, mapping each subject to its corresponding color.
     - This helps you easily understand the color coding of your timetable.

6. **Exam Day Highlighting**
   - Days with scheduled exams are labeled with an **"Exam"** indicator in red text.
   - **Revision Before Exams**:
     - The revision session immediately before an exam will always be a revision session for that exam, scheduled on the latest available block before the exam. This ensures you are well-prepared for each exam.
     - **No Overlapping Sessions**:
       - Revision sessions are **never scheduled at the same time as exams**, preventing any conflicts in your schedule.
     - If two exams are scheduled consecutively, the immediate revision session before these exams will be for the first (earlier) exam subject, scheduled on the latest available block. The revision session before that will be for the second (later) exam subject.
     - **Update**: The timetable generation logic has been improved to ensure that the last revision session before an exam is scheduled in the **latest available block** before the exam (e.g., Afternoon instead of Morning if both are available). This provides optimal preparation for your exams.

7. **No Revision Sessions During Exams**
   - The timetable automatically prevents scheduling of revision sessions during exam times.
   - This ensures that you have no conflicts and can focus entirely on your exams.

8. **No Revision After Final Exam**
   - After your final exam, no further revision sessions are scheduled, including later on the same day. This ensures that your timetable accurately reflects the completion of your exams.

9. **Select a Day to View Details**
   - Click on a date in the calendar to view its details.
   - The details of the selected day are displayed underneath the calendar, similar to the Apple Calendar app.
   - This includes any exams and revision sessions scheduled for that day.
     - For exams, the **Time of Day** is displayed.
     - Revision sessions are displayed with their corresponding **subject colors** for consistency.
   - Click on another date to view its details or click the same date again to hide the details.

10. **Navigate Between Months**
     - Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons, enhanced with icons, located below the calendar to navigate between months.
     - The current month and year are displayed at the top of the calendar.

11. **Saved Timetable**
     - The timetable is saved and can be accessed anytime by navigating to the **Timetable** page.

**Note**: The timetable now ensures that revision sessions do not overlap with exam times, providing a conflict-free schedule that allows you to focus on your exams when they occur.
