# View Timetable

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to the Timetable Page**
   - Use the navigation menu at the top to go to the **Timetable** page.

2. **Generate Timetable**
   - If you have added exams and set your preferences, click **Generate Timetable** to create your revision schedule.
   - The timetable is generated based on your preferences and exams.

3. **View Your Exams**
   - At the top of the timetable screen, all your upcoming exams are displayed for quick reference.
   - Exams are presented in a card format showing:
     - **Subject**
     - **Exam Date**
     - **Time of Day** (Morning, Afternoon, or Evening)
     - **Board**
     - **Teacher**
   - This allows you to easily keep track of your exams while viewing your revision schedule.

4. **Understand the Calendar View**
   - The timetable is displayed as a traditional monthly calendar grid optimized for all devices.
   - Each day in the calendar shows the date.

5. **Subject Indicators**
   - Each exam is assigned a unique color based on the order of your exams.
   - Days with scheduled revision sessions display small colored dots or squares representing the subjects you're set to revise.
   - The color indicators are arranged in the same order as your subjects, allowing you to quickly see which subjects you will be studying on each day without selecting the date.

6. **Exam Day Highlighting**
   - Days with scheduled exams are highlighted in **red**.
   - **Revision Before Exams**:
     - The revision session immediately before an exam will always be a revision session for that exam, scheduled on the latest available block before the exam. This ensures you are well-prepared for each exam.
     - If two exams are scheduled consecutively, the immediate revision session before these exams will be for the first (earlier) exam subject, scheduled on the latest available block. The revision session before that will be for the second (later) exam subject.
     - **Update**: The timetable generation logic has been improved to ensure that the last revision session before an exam is scheduled in the **latest available block** before the exam (e.g., Afternoon instead of Morning if both are available). This provides optimal preparation for your exams.

7. **No Revision After Final Exam**
   - After your final exam, no further revision sessions are scheduled, including later on the same day. This ensures that your timetable accurately reflects the completion of your exams.

8. **Select a Day to View Details**
   - Click on a date in the calendar to view its details.
   - The details of the selected day are displayed underneath the calendar, similar to the Apple Calendar app.
   - This includes any exams and revision sessions scheduled for that day.
     - For exams, the **Time of Day** is displayed.
   - Click on another date to view its details or click the same date again to hide the details.

9. **Navigate Between Months**
   - Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons, enhanced with icons, located below the calendar to navigate between months.
   - The current month and year are displayed at the top of the calendar.

10. **Revision Sessions are Color-Coded**
    - The detailed revision sessions displayed under the calendar are colored to match the colors for the subject, providing consistent visual cues.

11. **Saved Timetable**
    - The timetable is saved and can be accessed anytime by navigating to the **Timetable** page.

**Note**: The timetable generation logic ensures that you always have a revision session for an exam subject immediately before the exam, scheduled on the latest available block before the exam. No revision sessions are scheduled after your final exam, providing a clear end to your study schedule.
