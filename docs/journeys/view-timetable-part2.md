## Step-by-Step Guide Part 2

5. **Exam Day Highlighting**
   - Days with scheduled exams are labeled with an **"Exam"** indicator in red text.
   - **Revision Before Exams**:
     - The revision session immediately before an exam will always be for that exam's subject.
     - This session is scheduled in the **latest available block** before the exam (e.g., Afternoon instead of Morning if both are available).
     - This ensures you are optimally prepared for each exam.
   - **No Overlapping Sessions**:
     - Revision sessions are **never scheduled at the same time as exams**, preventing any scheduling conflicts.
   - **Consecutive Exams**:
     - If two exams are scheduled consecutively, the app ensures that revision sessions are appropriately allocated to prepare for both exams.

6. **Select a Day to View Details**
   - Click on a date in the calendar to view its details.
   - The details of the selected day are displayed underneath the calendar, similar to the Apple Calendar app.
   - This includes any exams and revision sessions scheduled for that day.
     - For exams, the **Time of Day** is displayed.
     - Revision sessions are displayed with their corresponding **subject colors** and include the **start and end times** for each session.
   - Click on another date to view its details or click the same date again to hide the details.

7. **Navigate Between Months**
   - Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons, enhanced with icons, located below the calendar to navigate between months.
   - The current month and year are displayed at the top of the calendar.

8. **Saved Timetable**
   - The timetable is saved and can be accessed anytime by navigating to the **Timetable** page.
   - Any changes to your exams or preferences will require you to regenerate the timetable to reflect the updates.
