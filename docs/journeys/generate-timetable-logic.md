## Understanding the Timetable Logic

- **Revision Session Allocation**:
  - The app schedules revision sessions based on your specified availability and the dates of your exams.
  - **Immediate Revision Sessions**:
    - The last revision session before an exam is allocated to that exam's subject.
    - This session is scheduled in the latest available block before the exam to ensure optimal preparation.
  - **Regular Revision Sessions**:
    - Remaining available slots are filled by distributing your subjects evenly.
    - Subjects with exams sooner are given priority.
- **Conflict Avoidance**:
  - Revision sessions are **never scheduled at the same time as exams**, preventing any scheduling conflicts.
  - If you have multiple exams on the same day or consecutive days, the app ensures your revision sessions are optimally distributed.
- **Exam Consideration**:
  - No revision sessions are scheduled after your final exam, including later on the same day.
  - This ensures that your timetable accurately reflects the completion of your exams.
- **Time Blocks and Customization**:
  - Revision sessions respect your custom time blocks and availability settings.
  - The start and end times for each session are displayed in your timetable, providing clear information about your schedule.
- **Subject Color Coding**:
  - Each subject is assigned a unique color.
  - Colored dots corresponding to each subject are displayed on the calendar, providing a quick visual overview.
  - A legend is included below the calendar to map subjects to their colors.
