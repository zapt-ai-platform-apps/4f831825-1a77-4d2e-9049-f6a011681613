# Design Principles

## Space Management

### Clean White Space

- **Consistent Padding and Margins**: Apply a base unit (8px) for spacing to ensure consistency.
- **Clear Separation**: Use whitespace to separate different sections and reduce cognitive load.
- **Breathing Room**: Allow elements room to breathe, making the interface feel less cluttered.

### Structured Layout

- **Responsive Grid System**: Utilize a grid that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Aligned Elements**: Align text and components to create a harmonious layout.
- **Predictable Patterns**: Maintain consistency in layout to help users navigate intuitively.

### Contextual Density

- **Spacious Layouts**: Use more space in content-focused areas like the timetable.
- **Prioritization**: Highlight important information to facilitate quick scanning.

## Visual Hierarchy

### Subtle Depth

- **Light Shadows and Gradients**: Create depth with subtle shadows and gradients.
- **Thin Borders**: Define interactive components with delicate borders.
- **Elevation for Modals**: Use gentle elevation to distinguish overlays.

### Clear Hierarchy

- **Emphasize Headings**: Use larger font sizes and bold weights for headings.
- **Highlight Primary Actions**: Employ color and size to draw attention to main actions.
- **Visual Relationships**: Group related elements to show their connection.

## User Experience

### Quiet Interface

- **Muted Backgrounds**: Use soft background colors to let content stand out.
- **Vibrant Accents**: Reserve bold colors for buttons and important messages.
- **Meaningful Color Coding**: Assign unique colors to each subject for easy identification.

### Gentle Interactions

- **Smooth Transitions**: Implement animations that are subtle and unobtrusive.
- **Hover Effects**: Provide feedback on interactive elements with gentle hover states.
- **Focus States**: Ensure focus indicators are noticeable but not distracting.

### Typography with Purpose

- **Limited Font Sizes**: Use a limited set of font sizes to create a clear hierarchy.
- **Readable Fonts**: Use 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for clarity and modern appeal.
- **Meaningful Weights**: Differentiate text elements with purposeful font weights.
