# Design Framework Documentation

Welcome to our structured app design framework. This guide will help you create consistent, user-centered designs for your applications using our comprehensive layered approach. The framework is organized into four main layers, each building upon the previous to create a complete design system.

## Design Process

1. [Design Strategy](strategy.md) - Define and prioritize UpGrade's core design values and characteristics
2. [Visual Theme](theme.md) - Outline and customize UpGrade's visual foundation
3. [Design Principles](principles.md) - Apply core design principles based on the strategy
4. [Implementation Plan](implementation.md) - Develop technical specifications and component patterns

## Getting Started

1. Begin by reviewing the [Design Strategy](strategy.md) to understand the core values guiding UpGrade.
2. Explore the [Visual Theme](theme.md) to see how the chosen theme supports the design strategy.
3. Delve into the [Design Principles](principles.md) to understand how design decisions are applied.
4. Refer to the [Implementation Plan](implementation.md) for technical specifications and component guidelines.

**Important:** Remember that UpGrade is a **mobile-first** design. All design decisions prioritize mobile experiences first, then scale up to larger screens.
