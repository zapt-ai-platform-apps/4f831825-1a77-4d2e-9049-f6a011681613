  // 1) Sort exams by date
  const sortedExams = [...userExams].sort((a, b) => new Date(a.examDate) - new Date(b.examDate));

  // 2) Build an array of blank sessions based on revisionTimesResult and the date range
  //    (We'll assume this has already been handled outside, or we can do partial checks if needed)
